#### Our Problem: We want to find the speed at which a Potato Cannon shoots a potato ####

*In this section, we plan to clearly and accurately outline our ambitions for this project, and we hope to reach a solution to our problem.*

 > **Our Project will be an arduos journey, but ultimately, it will be worthwile.**

Last year, in BACON, Harry and I brainstormed and came up with the idea of a Potato Cannon. We wanted to make a STEM related project that would be really cool to make and see the final result of. Our original plan last year was thwarted due to COVID-19, but we don't want that to stop us. We are aiming for a bigger and more complex project this time around. We plan to incorporate a Raspberry Pi and a Accelerometer to figure out how fast the capsule we shoot will go. It will be much more difficult, but the benefits outweigh the hardships. It's as they used to say in the 1980s, "No Pain, No Gain!"

### Details ###
This project has given us the opportunity to continue, enhance, and complete our original design. We plan on modifying our original design to allow an accelerometer to measure the speed of the potato. Fortunatly most of our parts are sitting somewhere in the Simga Lab so that definitely helps.
Our orginal plan called for:
- 4” PVC pipe – 1.5 feet
- 2” PVC pipe – 4 feet
- 4” PVC threaded coupler
- 4” PVC cleanout cap
- 4” to 2” PVC adapter
- PVC primer
- PVC cement
- Saw
- Drill with 1/2” drill bit
- Potatoes
- Tape measure 
- Stick lighter
- Hairspray (not pictured)

We will add:
- Accelerometer  <img src="LSM303-Module.jpg" width="70" height="50">
- Raspberyy Pi

This was the video we were going to use to assemble the cannon itself

This Video shows how the cannon itself fires but we will use a spark plug instead of a lighter.

We plan on also adding a raspberry pi, accelerometer and a few custom 3D printed parts.
