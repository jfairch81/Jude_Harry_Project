### What is a Potato Cannon?

Potato Cannons are small scale projectile launchers. They function by utilizing Air Pressure to accelerate a projectile through a launch tube. There are different types of Potato Cannons, but we are building a **Combustion Driven Potato Cannon.**

> In this type of Potato Cannon, there is a combustion chamber and a launch tube. Before firing, propellant fills the combustion chamber, and is then ignited. For  > our project, we will be using a **Spark Plug** to ignite the propellant.
